Task0-
Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(1)   //As the code runs only 2 lines

Task1-
Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n)   //n-sum of rows in calls.csv and texts.csv
										//zip takes O(n) time

Task2-
Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n)   //n-number of rows in calls.csv.
								   //As we run only a single loop iterating through the rows of calls.csv. Built-in functions take constant time

Task3-
Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(nlogn)	//n-numbers called by people in Bangalore
										//Loop takes O(n) time and sorted takes O(nlogn) time. So total time is max of them i.e O(nlogn)

Task4-
Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)		//n-number of rows in calls.csv.
										//Outer Loop takes O(n) time and checking takes O(n) time for each iteration.
